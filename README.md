BetterBible
===========

*The Bible has some issues. Let's make it better.*

The Bible has been around for a long time. The King James Version, one of the most famous English translations, has been around for over 400 years. And yet very little has changed. Christianity has changed. Society has changed. Science has revealed much to us. But we're still stuck with the same old boring, inaccurate, archaic Bible.

Here are the goals of the BetterBible project:

1. **Fix errors** — Where the Bible makes obvious mistakes, let's fix them.
2. **Inject humor** — The Bible can be a dry read and could do with some humor.
3. **Modernize** — Make it something that we can relate to. Jesus didn't address a topic? Well in this version, he can.
4. **Clarify** — The verses about homosexuals are apparently important and relevant today. Not so much the ones about shellfish and mixed fabrics. Let's not leave these things up to interpretation.
5. **Blaspheme** — Because none of the above would be very fun if we didn't.

Current status:

*The book of Genesis is now open for pull requests*

## Warning!
The book of Revelation has a dire warning for those who would attempt to edit it. It is unclear whether the same warning applies to other books in the Bible. Proceed with caution.

> **22:18**. For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:
>
> **22:19**. And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.
